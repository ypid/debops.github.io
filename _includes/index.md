#### Who spawned the creation of DebOps and why?

It was originally created by [drybjed](https://github.com/drybjed).

DebOps came out of necessity while working at an organization as a system administrator.

Since October 2013 it has been in constant development and used in production to provision and manage multiple hosts running under many different types of environments.
